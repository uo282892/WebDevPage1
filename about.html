                    <p>
                        We are an organization that was funded in 2016 by Peter Jones, a person whose love for the animals made him 
                        think about building something that could allocate a home for the worrying amount of pets that were left alone 
                        in the street.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As of today, more than 1000 animals have been rescued and allocated in safe houses in the Cork County, thanks to
                        the Virtual Pet Adoption Service. Our intention is to expand across Ireland, so that we can carry out our mission
                        all over our beautiful country.
