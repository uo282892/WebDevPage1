            <h2>How to care an adopted pet</h2>
            <h3>Feed the pet</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing you need to think about is feeding your pet. Make sure that the food that you are buying is of
                good quality, <strong>not every product is good for your pet</strong>. Investing more money in reliable brands
                will lead to less extraordinary visits to the vet, and the extra money you spend at the beginning will be worthy
                in the long run.
            </p>
            <h3>Watch out for the hygiene of the pet</h3>
            <p>
                The main cause of the most common illnesses that the pets suffer is the lack of hygiene. Every pet requires 
                different treatment for keeping it clean. We strongly advise to get specific information about your pet, so
                that you do not make any mistake with the products you buy or the way you sterilize your pet.
